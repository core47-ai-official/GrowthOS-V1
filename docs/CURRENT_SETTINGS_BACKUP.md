# Current Settings Backup - Pre-Fix Implementation

## Generated: 2025-01-19

This document serves as a backup of all current configurations before implementing the zero-breakage fix plan.

## Feature Flags (Before Changes)
```typescript
ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
ENHANCED_ERROR_HANDLING: true
SAFE_DATABASE_QUERIES: true
TYPE_SAFETY_IMPROVEMENTS: true
LMS_SEQUENTIAL_UNLOCK: false
```

## Critical Database Patterns Currently in Use

### .single() Usage Locations (14 total)
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`: Profile fetch
- `src/components/admin/StudentManagement.tsx`: Student record fetch
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx`: User profile fetch
- `src/hooks/useCompanyBranding.ts`: Company settings fetch
- Multiple other locations documented in search results

### Console Logging Count (209 total)
- Development debugging logs
- Error reporting in catch blocks
- Progress tracking logs
- API response logging

### Window.location.reload() Usage (4 locations)
- Authentication state reset
- Profile updates
- Settings changes
- Error recovery scenarios

## Recovery Rate Configuration
- Currently hard-coded at 85% in ENV_CONFIG.DEFAULT_RECOVERY_RATE
- Used when performance_record table is unavailable
- No real-time calculation implemented

## Current Error Handling Patterns
- Mix of console.error and proper error handling
- Some components lack error boundaries
- Inconsistent user feedback for errors

## Navigation Patterns
- React Router for primary navigation
- window.location.reload for state reset
- Mix of programmatic and declarative routing

## Type Safety Status
- Extensive use of 'any' types (estimated 100+ occurrences)
- Missing interfaces for API responses
- Loose typing in form handlers and event callbacks

## Performance Characteristics
- Sequential database queries in dashboard components
- No request batching
- Limited caching implementation
- Hard-coded timeouts and intervals

## Rollback Instructions
1. Revert feature flags to above settings
2. Restore console logging if needed for debugging
3. Keep .single() calls with existing error handling
4. Maintain current navigation patterns
5. Preserve existing type definitions

## Critical Success Metrics
- All 209 console logs preserved in development
- 14 .single() queries continue working with fallbacks
- 4 window.reload locations maintain functionality
- Dashboard recovery rate shows 85% (fallback working)
- All existing user workflows unaffected
