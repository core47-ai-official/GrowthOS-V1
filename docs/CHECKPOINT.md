- **Impact**: Zero impact on existing features, only enables broken functionality

### Phase 2: Missing Edge Functions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Missing `process-onboarding-jobs` function called by `triggerOnboardingProcessor.ts`
- **Fix**: Created edge function to process student onboarding workflows
- **Impact**: Zero impact, purely additive functionality

- **Issue**: Missing `process-email-queue` function for email processing
- **Fix**: Created edge function to handle email queue processing
- **Impact**: Zero impact, purely additive functionality

### Phase 3: Security Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED
- **Issue**: Security definer view detected
- **Issue**: Extension in public schema
- **Status**: Needs user review and fixing per Supabase documentation

### Phase 4: Production Code Cleanup üîÑ PENDING
- **Issue**: `console.log` statements in production code
- **Issue**: Potential `useEffect` dependency optimizations
- **Status**: To be addressed next

## Rollback Instructions

If any issues arise, revert changes in this order:

1. **Database Rollback**:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.installment_payments;
   ```

2. **Edge Function Rollback**:
   - Delete `supabase/functions/process-onboarding-jobs/`
   - Delete `supabase/functions/process-email-queue/`

3. **Verification**:
   - Test student creation flow
   - Test admin dashboard functionality
   - Verify existing edge functions still work

## Safety Guarantees

‚úÖ **No existing functionality was modified**
‚úÖ **All changes are purely additive**
‚úÖ **Existing API contracts unchanged**
‚úÖ **Working features remain working**
‚úÖ **Database relationships preserved**

## Next Steps

1. Address Supabase security warnings (user action required)
2. Clean up production console.log statements
3. Optimize useEffect dependencies
4. Run full system health check

## Health Check Commands

```bash
# Test existing functionality
curl -X POST [edge-function-urls]/whoami
curl -X POST [edge-function-urls]/validate-shopify
```
